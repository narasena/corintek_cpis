# Git Work

## Goal
Ensure a safe, reviewable git workflow from branch creation through commit:
- never commit to protected branches
- enforce project branching & naming conventions
- stage only intended changes
- create logically-scoped commits with clear messages

## 🛑 Critical Protocol – Start Any Task

**BEFORE writing any code or applying changes, you MUST:**

1.  **Check Current Branch:**
    Run `git branch --show-current`.

2.  **Validate Branch:**
    - If current branch is `main`, `master`, `dev`, `development`, `development_v2`, `stage`: **STOP**.
    - You **MUST** create a new branch.

3.  **Create Branch (If Needed):**
    - Ask the user for the task type (Feature, Bug, Refactor) if not clear.
    - Enforce Naming Convention:
      - Feature: `feat/<domain>/<action>`
      - Bug Fix: `fix/<domain>/<issue>`
      - Refactor: `refactor/<scope>`
    - Command: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`

4.  **Verify:**
    - Confirm you are on the new branch.
    - Proceed with the task.

## Commit Workflow (checklist)

When ready to commit:

1) Inspect the working tree before staging
   - `git status`
   - `git diff` (unstaged)
   - If many changes: `git diff --stat`

2) Decide commit boundaries (split if needed)
   - Split by: feature vs refactor, backend vs frontend, formatting vs logic, tests vs prod code, dependency bumps vs behavior changes.
   - If changes are mixed in one file, plan to use patch staging.

3) Stage only what belongs in the next commit
   - Prefer patch staging for mixed changes: `git add -p`
   - To unstage a hunk/file: `git restore --staged -p` or `git restore --staged <path>`

4) Review what will actually be committed
   - `git diff --cached`
   - Sanity checks:
     - no secrets or tokens
     - no accidental debug logging
     - no unrelated formatting churn

5) Describe the staged change in 1-2 sentences (before writing the message)
   - "What changed?" + "Why?"
   - If you cannot describe it cleanly, the commit is probably too big or mixed; go back to step 2.

6) Write the commit message
   - Use Conventional Commits (required):
     - `type(scope): short summary`
     - blank line
     - body (what/why, not implementation diary)
     - footer (BREAKING CHANGE) if needed
   - Prefer an editor for multi-line messages: `git commit -v`
   - Use `references/commit-message-template.md` if helpful.

7) Run the smallest relevant verification
   - Run the repo's fastest meaningful check (unit tests, lint, or build) before moving on.

8) Repeat for the next commit until the working tree is clean

## Deliverable
Provide:
- the final commit message(s)
- a short summary per commit (what/why)
- the commands used to stage/review (at minimum: `git diff --cached`, plus any tests run)
